                       <p>Recap: Integrity Pools is amazing!!! Use these guys, you’ll be glad you did! Our pool was needing a replaster – and we started seeing some erosion around the spa from years of poor pressure and weather. I interviewed 7 different companies to help with this project. It seems that the pool industry is run amuck with “fly by night” businesses that are not dependable and can do a sub-standard job. Integrity Pools in Richardson was exceptional. David, the new projects salesman we worked with, handled us with care through entire process. Communication was amazing – from very simple questions to the more complex explanations of the process their team would do. The biggest negative I have is their contract is overwhelming. It goes to show how difficult this business can be with so many factors out of the hands of the contractor and the homeowner (pools / water / different levels of care from one owner to the next / different levels of competency of the regular maintenance, etc, etc, etc). When signing the contract, I let the team know that their contract was not the greatest I’d read and that I hope it was all meaningless because of the job they would do would be perfect. I’m happy to say it is a beautiful finish out and a great company! We couldn’t be happier with our choice. With 7 different bids, Integrity was not the cheapest option – but they were not the most expensive either – but their process, communication and workmanship is the best I’ve worked with.s</p>

                       <p>I called Integrity Pools to obtain a quote for re-tiling my pool. My pool was re-plastered by the previous homeowner without replacing the tile, so the plaster at this point was still in good shape. My tiles on the other hand - falling off, cracked, etc., and the source of my water / pool leak. I have received several quotes but what set Integrity Pools apart from the other companies I had engaged was the level of professionalism from their team upon our first meeting. Their quote was very competitive and in line with others I had received. I chose Integrity Pools given their level of detail in explanation of the steps to undertake this project, and consistent follow-up and updates as far as scheduling went. They walked me through exactly what to expect and timing. I have to say, comparing the verbal outline for timing and project expectations to reality- it was spot on. Prior to commencement of the work, they stopped by with tile samples so I could see them in person. This is going above and beyond in my opinion, especially when looking back on past projects I have had done around this house and others I have owned in the past. I scheduled the work to be done a couple of weeks out as I had travel plans and house guests. Weather during this time delayed the start of my project, which is beyond anyone's control. They called me to keep me posted of scheduling and never left me hanging. Much appreciated! Day one was spent draining my pool. Day two, the crew showed up at 8:30 as promised. During the day of the re-tiling, a couple members from their team stopped by to check on things and answer any questions I had. That too is going above and beyond. I really appreciated that gesture. Again, consistent professionalism the whole way through. At the end of the day, the tile work was done and the pool was being refilled. They left my back yard clean. I couldn't tell anyone had been back there (aside from an empty, nicely re-tiled pool). I'm very happy with the level of service, the professionalism (again - very huge in home improvement projects, and I have done many over the course of having owned 3 houses during my time, and it's honestly a breath of fresh air to be kept advised of the "going-ons" during what can be viewed as a stressful situation) and the quality of the work that was done. I love the new tile and the way it looks. And the pool is holding its water, as it should! I definitely recommend Integrity Pools for any work you may be considering for your pool or backyard. I know who to call on for future needs!

                       <p>David was very knowledgable but our pool does not look anything like the sample. We had new tile and plaster done, after our pool like didn't work so another $1265 and Mathew the owner outright accused me of trying to SCAM him. Paid for the 2 week aftercare, $600 and the man who came by our home 6 times in 2 weeks checked chemicals 3 times, put Shock in once (left it all lying on the bottom of the pool) brushed the pool very little and come to the last day and hooked up my Polaris and when I came home pumps not working. I have all on video, watched as this man spent a total of 10 minutes in my yard not the last day and only put the Polaris in then sat in his truck the rest of the 15 minutes at my home. Very disappointed. Matthew the owner came to my home to look at the problem and agreed to work to fix it. I am changing my opinion of this company's service! Our pool now looks like I expected after a remodel, Matthew did as he said he would and we are now happy with the results. I believe I may have posted to early and apologize to this company, they have proven their name!</p>

I love the new look and my backyard has been transformed. If you need repairs to your deck, Integrity Pools had no trouble with the process. Other companies wouldn't touch it, but the subcontractor they used was excellent in raising a settled deck. I am a happy camper and am looking forward to finishing a little landscaping and be ready for next season. Thanks from a very satisfied customer.</p>

                       <p>Integrity Pools lives up to its name! We needed to change the flaking discolored flagstone around our pool. David, the salesperson came to provide us an estimate. I was very impressed with David - he arrived on time, was professional and did not try to upsell me on pool repair that was not needed. The estimate was fair and reasonable. Mathew, the owner called to confirm our needs and discuss the contract and payment. The tear down was done efficiently and took less than a day. The two workers that installed the flagstone did an amazing job! They were able to match the color of the current flagstone in the patio and created a smooth professional overflow from the spa into the pool. All of the employees were respectful of me, my time and my property. I highly recommend Integrity Pools for pool repairs and will call them again when our pool requires their services.</p>

                       <p>My wife and I always wanted to put a pool in. The one problem we had was, "WHO COULD WE TRUST"? I got on line and found INTEGRITY POOLS! I called them and scheduled a appointment with the owner, Matthew. After meeting with Matthew, my wife and I where convinced that this is who we wanted to build a pool for us. I told Matthew that this pools was important to us, because we have three grandchildren and I am about to retire. We wanted a GOOD/FUN pool. That is what they gave us. We put it in late but we have really enjoyed the hot tub and the water fall. Thank you Integrity pools!</p>

                       <p>We had our pool completely re-plastered and it looks amazing. I took a star off for scheduling miscommunications. Its been a week since we had our pool completed and still have not been able to sync up to get chemicals and the plaster brushed. They cant get into our yard unless we know ahead of time since we travel often and need to have dogs locked up, etc. When they were not scheduled, they showed up and couldn't work, then when they were scheduled they didn't show. They also put the hose in the pool last Friday to fill it and we had plans to go out of town that evening but had to stay because we didn't know if we were expected to turn the water off or if the technicians would return to do it. We never heard anything and turned it off when it looks full on Saturday. The quality of the work is AMAZING however and the pool was completely remodeled in 2 days which is incredible. Overall I would recommend them, but the technicians should communicate more with their office to keep things on track.</p>

They did an outstanding job--even replacing wooden spacers that had been used between the concrete sections of the deck. It looks just terrific. Although I service my own pool most of the time, I love having a service I can call when I need emergency service or maintenance that is outside my skill set! It's a great company.

                       <p>I discussed my project with 4 companies before choosing to work with Integrity Pools. They listened to what I said & helped me design it in a way that looks amazing- better than I would have been able to do on my own. We started my project on August 15th and then it poured rain. They stayed in communication and kept the project moving along. My friend hired a pool company and their pool sat with scheduled workers who did not show up. These guys moved faster than expected and are total pros! My pool is amazing and some of the workers were so meticulous and polite- I would have them for dinner. Better experience than I ever could have expected! I HIGHLY recommend!!! Amazing service & was a joy to do- even with the rain!</p>

                       <p>I'm very cynical when considering to hire on contractor for their services, but I've experienced exceptional results recently when I decided to award Integrity Pools the contract to remodel our swimming pool. From the initial consultation, throughout the work process, to the final day, and the follow up by management after the project was complete deserves nothing but a 5 star rating. I would highly, highly recommend them for anyone looking at a pool remodel project.</p>

                       <p>Last year, we hired Integrity Pools to help us with our 50 year old pool that has popped up on the deep end over 7 inches. Other companies we had consulted recommended removing the old pool and installing a new one which would have been an astronomical expense. Integrity came up with a solution that solved all our problems for a fraction of the cost. The work was completed within the estimated time frame and price and we are absolutely thrilled with the finished product. We are proud of our backyard and pool now and would recommend Integrity Pools to anyone!</p>

                       <p>Now that was an interesting experience. I had a visit yesterday from a nice gentleman with a neat Australian Accent. He represented Integrity pools and we talked in great depth about what happened. He explained that the 'Problem' was rooted in the business model - which they are currently changing. That the repair man who 'erroneously' charged me for what should have been Warrantee work: a) Made a bad call. Things like that can happen if work with independent contractors who are responsible for their own actions. b) No longer works for them. That really bumms me out though. It was not my intention to get anybody fired, I just thought this fella made one very, suspiciously, bad call. Anyways, all suspicions aside and cleared up, up to two stars. The gentleman agreed that the work should have been done on warranty and handed me over a check for that amount. I'm still amazed! up to 3 Stars. I also asked for documentation about the ILink Unit they installed for me. I'm a hands-on software and hardware freek and I may need to change the WiFi Connection parameters. They responded within 24 hours with all the information I needed to do anything I want, up to four stars. Nowadays, if you call somewhere needing something you typically need several minutes to get past the automated computerised call handling system. In these days, when contacting a real person if you have a problem is a nerve wrecking challenge, it's a refreshing change of pace to see someone take the time to really try to set things straight with a customer. It really looks like they are trying to live up to the name "Integrity".</p>

                       <p>We had them come and clean our pool for close to a year. We have a special section in out pool equipment for the chlorine tabs but they always threw them directly into the pool despite our requesting not too. This resulted in our pool being over chlorinated and making it hard to swim since it would burn our eyes and dry out our skin. We then had them do a filter clean. after they left, the filter began to leak water severely and a cap was stuck on the filtration basket just before the filter. We asked them to come back and they said the gasket on the filter had suddenly failed and they looked at the wrong filter cap despite my description. This fix was going to cost us quite a bit so I had our home warranty check it out and they said that they gasket only had to be lubed. They fixed it and it is running well now. Wish we had a better experience.</p>

All techs were very pleasant and did their best. I had a warranty issue with the leak detection. They did not ask any questions in attempt to get out of the service call.
